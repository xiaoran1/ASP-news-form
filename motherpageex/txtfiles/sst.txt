He was acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday via trade.

"We are very pleased to have agreed to a long-term deal with Andrew Shaw," said general manager Marc Bergevin. "As I mentioned last Friday following his acquisition, we are adding a solid character player to our team, a reliable player who plays with grit and a two-time Stanley Cup champion with the Chicago Blackhawks over the past five seasons. Andrew will add more leadership to our team.

"I had the opportunity to discuss with him over the past few days, and I sense his determination and excitement in joining the Canadiens' organization for many years to come."

A five-year NHL veteran, the Belleville, Ont., native won the Stanley Cup twice in Chicago, hoisting the NHL's championship trophy in 2012-13 and again in 2014-15.
